# Part 2: Deploying an LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Task/Activity:
In this part of the workshop, you will:
- Deploy a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using an LLM from Fireworks.
- Connect to a **vector store** (to be decided) to retrieve relevant documents and use the LLM to generate contextually accurate responses based on the retrieved data.

## Relevant Concepts/Skills:
By completing this task, you will:
- Learn how **RAG** works and how combining retrieval with generation improves model responses.
- Understand how to connect to and query a **vector store** for document retrieval.
- Gain experience in building AI systems that combine retrieval and generation to handle more complex queries.

## Background Information:

### **A. Embeddings**
- **What They Are**: Vector representations of text, images, or other data types. These vectors capture semantic meaning and are used in retrieval systems (e.g., vector stores) to find similar data points.
- **Why It Matters**: Embeddings allow you to search large datasets for semantically similar documents or content, which is critical for tasks like RAG, recommendation systems, or even advanced search applications.

### **B. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **What It Is**: A combination of a retrieval mechanism (like a vector store) and a generative model (like an LLM). This approach allows a model to pull in external knowledge or context when generating responses, making its output more accurate and relevant.
- **Why It Matters**: Standard LLMs are limited by their training data and context window. RAG enhances these models by fetching relevant information from a database or document store before generating a response, improving accuracy and contextual understanding.

### **C. Vector Databases**
- **What They Are**: Databases that store embeddings (vectors) and allow for similarity searches. These are used in retrieval systems to find documents or data points most similar to a given query.
- **Why It Matters**: In RAG systems, vector databases (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS) enable quick and efficient retrieval of relevant information to feed into an LLM for more contextually aware responses.

## Fireworks-Specific Information:
- Fireworks AI allows you to query LLMs easily and integrates well with retrieval systems. You can combine Fireworks models with vector stores to build a RAG system.
  - **Text Models Querying Guide**: [Querying Text Models](https://docs.fireworks.ai/guides/querying-text-models)
  - **Fireworks Python Client Setup**: [Install the Fireworks Python Client](https://docs.fireworks.ai/tools-sdks/python-client/installation)

## Steps to Accomplish the Task:

1. **Step 1: Set Up Fireworks API and Choose a Model**:
    - Install the Fireworks Python client and authenticate using your API key:
    ```bash
    pip install fireworks
    ```
    - In your Python code:
    ```python
    import fireworks

    # Initialize Fireworks client
    client = fireworks.Client(api_key="your_api_key")

    # Choose a model from Fireworks (e.g., a text generation model)
    model_name = "your_llm_model"
    ```

2. **Step 2: Set Up the Vector Store**:
    - Depending on the chosen vector store (e.g., Pinecone), youâ€™ll need to initialize the store and add documents.
    ```python
    import pinecone

    # Initialize Pinecone
    pinecone.init(api_key="your_pinecone_api_key", environment="us-west1-gcp")

    # Create or connect to an index
    index = pinecone.Index("your_index_name")
    ```

3. **Step 3: Ingest Documents into the Vector Store**:
    - Generate embeddings for your documents and store them in the vector store:
    ```python
    documents = ["Document 1 text...", "Document 2 text..."]
    embeddings = [generate_embedding(doc) for doc in documents]
    
    # Insert documents into the vector store
    for doc, embedding in zip(documents, embeddings):
        index.upsert([{"id": doc_id, "values": embedding, "metadata": {"text": doc}}])
    ```

4. **Step 4: Query the Vector Store and Pass Data to the LLM**:
    - Retrieve relevant documents based on the user's query and pass them to the LLM:
    ```python
    query = "How to optimize model training?"
    
    # Generate embedding for the query
    query_embedding = generate_embedding(query)

    # Retrieve relevant documents
    result = index.query(queries=[query_embedding], top_k=3)
    relevant_docs = [match['metadata']['text'] for match in result['matches']]
    
    # Pass retrieved data to the LLM
    prompt = f"Based on the following documents: {relevant_docs}, answer the query: {query}"
    response = client.generate(model_name=model_name, prompt=prompt)
    print(response['text'])
    ```

5. **Step 5: Perform a Vibe Check on the RAG System**:
    - Test the system with different queries and retrieved documents to verify that the LLM generates more contextually accurate responses based on the retrieved information.
