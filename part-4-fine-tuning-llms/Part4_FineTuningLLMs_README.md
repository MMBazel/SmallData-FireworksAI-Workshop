# Part 4: Fine-Tuning a Base LLM and Exploring Function-Calling LLMs

## Task/Activity:
In this part of the workshop, you will:
- Fine-tune a **base LLM** using Fireworks AI.
- Explore the specific requirements for fine-tuning a **function-calling LLM**.
- Kick off the fine-tuning process, with alternatives to full tuning like prompt engineering or using pre-tuned models.

## Relevant Concepts/Skills:
By completing this task, you will:
- Learn how to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to better suit specific tasks or domains.
- Understand the challenges and specific requirements involved in fine-tuning a **function-calling LLM**.
- Explore **prompt engineering** as an alternative to full fine-tuning.
- Gain experience with deploying pre-tuned models, such as those available on **Fireworks' serverless platform**.

## Background Information:
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning involves adjusting a pre-trained model’s weights using domain-specific or task-specific data to improve its performance in specialized tasks. Unlike training a model from scratch, fine-tuning is faster and more efficient.

- **Function-Calling LLMs**: Fine-tuning a function-calling LLM requires a dataset that clearly demonstrates where and when functions should be invoked. This allows the model to understand complex workflows and decision-making processes, making it an important tool in building systems like chatbots, task automation, or digital assistants.

- **Prompt Engineering**: Instead of fine-tuning, **prompt engineering** can be used to craft prompts that guide the model to behave in a specific way. This is a faster alternative to fine-tuning and can work well in many cases.

## Fireworks-Specific Information:
- Fireworks provides tools for both fine-tuning models and utilizing pre-tuned models for quick deployment. It also offers serverless platforms to run models without needing infrastructure setup.
  - **Fireworks Python Client Setup**: [Install the Fireworks Python Client](https://docs.fireworks.ai/tools-sdks/python-client/installation)
  - **Using Pre-Tuned Models**: [FireFunc on Serverless](https://fireworks.ai/models?show=Serverless)

## Steps to Accomplish the Task:

1. **Step 1: Set Up Fireworks API and Choose a Base Model for Fine-Tuning**:
    - Install the Fireworks Python client and authenticate using your API key:
    ```bash
    pip install fireworks
    ```
    - In your Python code:
    ```python
    import fireworks

    # Initialize Fireworks client
    client = fireworks.Client(api_key="your_api_key")

    # Choose a base model for fine-tuning
    model_name = "your_base_llm"
    ```

2. **Step 2: Fine-Tune the Model**:
    - Define the fine-tuning parameters and kick off the fine-tuning job:
    ```python
    fine_tune_config = {
        "dataset": "path_to_your_dataset",
        "epochs": 3,
        "learning_rate": 2e-5
    }

    # Start the fine-tuning process
    fine_tune_job = client.fine_tune(model_name=model_name, config=fine_tune_config)
    print(f"Fine-tuning started: Job ID {fine_tune_job['job_id']}")
    ```

3. **Step 3: Fine-Tuning a Function-Calling LLM (Discussion)**:
    - Discuss the requirements for fine-tuning function-calling models:
      - Datasets should include examples where function calls are necessary.
      - You’ll need to provide function parameters and expected behavior so the model can learn how to trigger functions correctly.

4. **Step 4: Explore Alternatives to Full Fine-Tuning**:
    - Consider the following alternatives if full fine-tuning isn’t possible within the workshop:
      - **Prompt Engineering**: Craft specific prompts that influence the model’s behavior without retraining.
      ```python
      prompt = "You are a virtual assistant. When a user asks to schedule a meeting, offer to call the scheduling function."
      result = client.generate(model_name="your_base_llm", prompt=prompt)
      print(result['text'])
      ```

      - **Using Pre-Tuned Models**: Fireworks offers pre-tuned models like **FireFunc** on a serverless platform, which can be deployed instantly:
      ```python
      # Using a pre-tuned model on Fireworks' serverless platform
      model_name = "FireFunc"
      result = client.generate(model_name=model_name, prompt="Schedule a meeting")
      print(result['text'])
      ```

5. **Step 5: Perform a Vibe Check on the Fine-Tuned Model**:
    - Once fine-tuning is complete (or if using a pre-tuned model), run a few test queries to evaluate how well the model performs on the new task or domain.
