# Part 1: Connecting to Fireworks & Building a Model Comparison App

## Objectives:
In this part of the workshop, you will:
- Connect to Fireworks AI's platform to access a list of hosted models.
- Utilize a **Streamlit app** that allows users to compare different models from Fireworks via a dropdown menu.
- Perform initial “vibe checks” by querying the selected models.

---

## Relevant Concepts/Skills:
By completing this task, you will:
- Learn how to use Fireworks' API to interact with and query LLMs and multimodal models.
- Gain hands-on experience with building interactive apps using **Streamlit**.

We'll also cover:
- The different types of models (text vs multimodal).
- The difference between chat vs completion models.
- Some key parameters for text models versus visual-language models.

--- 

## Background Information:
- **Model Types**: Fireworks AI offers multiple types of models:
  - **Text Models**: These are used for tasks like text generation, completion, or Q&A.
  - **Multimodal Models**: These handle multiple data types, such as text and images.
  - **Chat vs Completion Models**: Chat models are optimized for back-and-forth conversations, while completion models generate a single block of text from a given prompt.
  

- **Streamlit**: A Python-based framework for building and deploying simple web apps. You’ll use Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface to interact with the models.

# Task 1: Explore models available on Fireworks via the model playground:

## Background
Fireworks AI provides access to multiple models that vary in architecture and functionality, ranging from simple text models to more complex multimodal models. These models are hosted on Fireworks' platform, and you can use the Model Playground feature to explore and query different models. You’ll get hands-on experience interacting with various LLMs and multimodal models, comparing their outputs and determining their suitability for different tasks.

## Activity
- Use Fireworks' **Model Playground** to explore the different available models.
- Compare text and multimodal models by performing queries and analyzing the results.
- Document your observations for each model to understand how they handle different input types.
  
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the Fireworks Model Playground.
2. Select different models from the dropdown menu and run queries using sample prompts.
3. Observe the output generated by the models and compare their behaviors.

# Task 2: Connect to Fireworks model APIs using Streamlit

## Background
- **Fireworks API**: Fireworks provides a simple API to query its hosted models. You can interact with the API to retrieve available models, send queries, and get results from LLMs. This part of the workshop will involve setting up your environment to connect to the Fireworks API and then building a basic Streamlit app to interact with the models.

  - **Text Models Querying Guide**: [Querying Text Models](https://docs.fireworks.ai/guides/querying-text-models)
  - **Embedding Models Querying Guide**: [Querying Embedding Models](https://docs.fireworks.ai/guides/querying-embeddings-models)
  - **Python Client Setup**: [Install the Fireworks Python Client](https://docs.fireworks.ai/tools-sdks/python-client/installation)

## Activity
In this task, you will:
- Build a basic **Streamlit** app that lists the available models from Fireworks.
- Allow users to select a model and perform a basic query.
- Display the results in the Streamlit interface, enabling easy comparison of different model outputs.

**Steps**:
1. Set up your local environment with the Fireworks Python Client.
2. Write the code for a Streamlit app that connects to Fireworks API.
3. Create a dropdown menu in Streamlit that lists available models.
4. Build an input field where users can provide their query prompts.
5. Display the results from the model query in the Streamlit app.

By completing these tasks, you'll have a working app that can compare multiple models in real-time and a foundational understanding of how to interact with Fireworks' API to query different models.
