# Part 1: Connecting to Fireworks & Building a Model Comparison App

## Objectives:
In this part of the workshop, you will:
- Connect to Fireworks AI's platform to access a list of hosted models.
- Utilize a **Streamlit app** that allows users to compare different models from Fireworks via a dropdown menu.
- Perform initial “vibe checks” by querying the selected models.

---

## Relevant Concepts/Skills:
By completing this task, you will:
- Learn how to use Fireworks' API to interact with and query LLMs and multimodal models.
- Gain hands-on experience with building interactive apps using **Streamlit**.

We'll also cover:
- The different types of models (text vs multimodal).
- The difference between chat vs completion models.
- Some key parameters for text models versus visual-language models.

## Background Information:
- **Model Types**: Fireworks AI offers multiple types of models:
  - **Text Models**: These are used for tasks like text generation, completion, or Q&A.
  - **Multimodal Models**: These handle multiple data types, such as text and images.
  - **Chat vs Completion Models**: Chat models are optimized for back-and-forth conversations, while completion models generate a single block of text from a given prompt.

- **Streamlit**: A Python-based framework for building and deploying simple web apps. You’ll use Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface to interact with the models.

# Task 2: Connect to Fireworks model APIs using streamlit
## Background
- **Fireworks API**: Fireworks provides a simple API to query its hosted models. You can interact with the API to retrieve available models, send queries, and get results from LLMs.
