# Part 6: The "Ops" Part of Compound AI Systems

## Task/Activity:
In this part of the workshop, you will:
- Understand the **operational aspects** of managing a compound AI system.
- Learn about **MLOps** practices that ensure smooth development, deployment, and scaling of AI systems.
- Explore best practices for maintaining performance, monitoring models, and retraining models in production.

## Relevant Concepts/Skills:
By completing this task, you will:
- Learn about the **lifecycle management** of AI models, including versioning, retraining, and scaling.
- Understand the **importance of monitoring and logging** in production environments to maintain the performance of AI systems.
- Explore **automation tools** for deploying and updating models, including scaling and resource management.
  
## Background Information:
- **What is MLOps?**: MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices and tools designed to manage the deployment and operational lifecycle of AI models. It ensures that models are properly monitored, updated, and scaled as needed once they are in production.
  
- **Model Lifecycle Management**: The lifecycle of a model involves multiple stages, from initial development and deployment to ongoing retraining and versioning. Models in production must be regularly monitored and updated to prevent performance degradation.

- **Best Practices for MLOps**:
  - **Versioning**: Keep track of different versions of models, ensuring that you can easily roll back to previous versions if issues arise.
  - **Monitoring and Logging**: Regularly monitor the performance of models in production, including response times, accuracy, and resource usage.
  - **Retraining**: Periodically retrain models using new data to maintain or improve performance and prevent model drift.

## Fireworks-Specific Information:
- Fireworks provides features for easily deploying and updating models, with built-in tools for model versioning and monitoring.
  - **Fireworks Python Client Setup**: [Install the Fireworks Python Client](https://docs.fireworks.ai/tools-sdks/python-client/installation)
  - **Model Monitoring Documentation**: Fireworks AI also supports monitoring tools for tracking model performance.

## Steps to Accomplish the Task:

1. **Step 1: Set Up Fireworks for Model Monitoring**:
    - Start by setting up monitoring for your deployed models on Fireworks.
    ```python
    import fireworks

    # Initialize Fireworks client
    client = fireworks.Client(api_key="your_api_key")

    # Retrieve logs and metrics for a deployed model
    model_name = "your_model_name"
    logs = client.get_model_logs(model_name=model_name)
    print(logs)
    ```

2. **Step 2: Implement Logging for Model Performance**:
    - Implement logging to track important metrics such as latency, accuracy, and resource usage.
    ```python
    def log_model_performance(model_name, metrics):
        with open(f"{model_name}_performance_logs.txt", "a") as log_file:
            log_file.write(f"Metrics for {model_name}: {metrics}
")
    ```

3. **Step 3: Automate Model Retraining**:
    - Set up an automated retraining pipeline that retrains your models based on performance metrics or new data.
    ```python
    def retrain_model(model_name, new_data):
        retrain_job = client.fine_tune(model_name=model_name, dataset=new_data)
        print(f"Retraining job started: {retrain_job['job_id']}")
    ```

4. **Step 4: Scale the Compound AI System**:
    - Implement auto-scaling for your models and systems to handle increased workloads or traffic spikes.
    - Use cloud infrastructure to automatically scale the resources based on demand, ensuring that the system remains responsive and cost-effective.

5. **Step 5: Version Control and Continuous Integration**:
    - Implement version control for your models to track changes and ensure compatibility with the production environment.
    - Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the process of deploying new models and updating existing ones without downtime.

6. **Step 6: Monitor and Maintain the System**:
    - Regularly monitor the performance of the entire compound AI system, ensuring that each component is performing optimally.
    - Use dashboards and alerts to track key metrics in real time, and respond to any performance issues or anomalies immediately.
